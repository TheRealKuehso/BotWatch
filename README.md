# BotWatch by kuehso

## What is it for?
This little app can help you or your mods to identify any bots on your stream.

## What may it be good for in the future?
I am currently working on a way to kick / ban bots on button click.
Futhermore, there should be a list of accepted bots, as not all bots are bad. These accepted bots should not be listed.

## How do I run BotWatch?
```java -jar BotWatch_<version>.jar``` should do the trick.
